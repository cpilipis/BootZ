# BootZ
An open-source, top-down 2D zombie shooter.

## Conception
I know that the market is saturated chock full of zombie games right now. But, I noticed two things:

1. There's not a lot of open-source or libre-software zombie games out there right now
2. Most zombie games in general depict a post-apocalypse rather than the scenario I'm trying to pain.
